Delleren is an addon that simplifies the process of identifying and calling for spells from other players in your raid. Both you and the player you want to call for CDs must have Delleren installed. For optimal results, your entire raid should have Delleren installed.

================================================================================
Quick Start:

Create a macro and paste this into it:

    /delleren call painsups

And use that macro to call for a defensive CD. Reading the rest of the manual is highly recommended.

================================================================================
Configuration:

Type /delleren config in your chat window to open the Delleren configuration panel.

Configuration sections:

  CD Bar: Options for the CD bar.
  Indicator: Options to style the main indicator.
  Profiles: Profile creation and loading.
  Sounds: Options for which sounds are associated with events.
  Tracked Spells: Spell tracking editor.

================================================================================
Calling:

The "call" command is used to call for CDs from other players. It's usage is:

    /delleren call {spell list} [options]

{spell list} is a plain list of numbers that correspond to spell IDs that you would like your raid to cast. An easy way to get spell IDs is from wowhead URLs. Just do a web search for "<spellname> wowhead" and the first result will likely be it's wowhead article and the number in the URL is the spell ID. There's also a spell ID search tool included in the Delleren configuration panel under Tracked Spells.

There are also a few presets listed below that you can use to populate your spell list.

If you call for spells that are being "tracked" (see Tracking) then the call is instant and doesn't have to wait for responses from the raid first.

Options:

-i : Item mode. 

If this flag is set, then the spell list will be treated as a list of item IDs instead. In other words, you may call for an item to be used rather than a spell.

-m : Manual mode. 

If this flag is set, the query system will not automatically choose a player to call a spell from. A window will open that lets you select which player to call.

-c : Simple cast mode. 

If this flag is set, the query system won't check for a buff being cast on you. Rather, the request will be satisfied if the person called simply casts the spell, not caring if they cast it on someone or if the spell isn't castable on a target. This is mainly used for spells that don't provide a buff.

-p : Player list. 

This option is followed by a list of player names or special keywords that determine who we should call for a spell. Players who are listed first will be prioritized over players who are listed after. It doesn't guarantee that the order will be followed exactly because of latency issues. For example, the highest priority player could experience a bit of lag and not respond in time to the request, thus being skipped for a call. 

The special keywords are "*t" which matches any tank, "*h" which matches any healer, "*d" which matches any damager, and "*" which matches anyone.

For example: "-p llanna delleren regal" will try to request a spell from those three players, giving llanna the highest priority and then end the query if none of those three have a desired spell available. If you add a * to the end, then it will *try* to get a spell from those three before resorting to getting something from any other player who can satisfy the request.

If you don't provide your own filter, there are default filters that are used depending on your role. If you are a tank, then the default filter is:

    "*t *h *d *" 

-which means, prefer calling a tank, over a healer, over the damagers. If you aren't a tank, then the default filter is: 

    "*h *d *t *" 

-which means, prefer calling from healers, over damagers, over tanks.


It's best explained with examples:

    /delleren call 6940 33206 114030 102342

These spell IDs are Hand of Sacrifice, Pain Suppression, Vigilance, and Ironbark. This command will ask for one of these spells from anyone who can give them.

    /delleren call 6940 33206 114030 102342 -m

Same as before, but it will open a menu to let you choose who to call from.

    /delleren call 76577 -c

Ask for a smoke bomb (spell ID 76577) to be used. Since Smoke Bomb doesn't target players directly, the -c flag is used to tell the system that you don't expect a buff to be cast on yourself.

    /delleren call 33206 -p regal

Ask for Pain Suppresion from a player named Regal, and fail the request if it's on CD.

    /delleren call 6940 33206 114030 102342 -p regal daxsik *

Ask for damage reduction CDs, but prefer getting one from your trusty healers named Regal and Daxsik before resorting to getting one from other players.

    /delleren call 49040 -i

Call for a Jeeves (item ID 49040) to be summoned. -i makes it an item request.

    /delleren call jeeves -i -m

List who has a Jeeves available to be used. The spell preset "jeeves" was used here. See below for other presets.

    /delleren call painsups -p *h

Call for a defensive CD from any healer.


Spell presets may be used along with spell IDs, the current ones are:

"painsups" - Hand of Sacrifice, Pain Suppression, Vigilance, and Ironbark
"jeeves" - Jeeves (item)

================================================================================
Indicator

The Delleren Indicator is easy to understand. If it's flashing and making noise, that means you need to cast the spell that's shown on the player that's shown. You have around seven seconds to do so.

================================================================================
Tracking/CD Bar

Delleren provides a simple cooldown tracking interface that allows you to easily see if certain desired spells are available in your raid via the CD Bar. The CD Bar can be toggled on or off in the configuration panel. Disabling the CD Bar will increase performance slightly.

If you call for a tracked spell, the query system already knows who has the spell ready and reacts faster. These are called instant-queries.

The buttons on the CD Bar may be clicked to call for the corresponding spells. Left-click makes an auto-query. Right-click makes a manual-query, so a menu will be shown, listing who has the spell ready.

Which spells are tracked is controlled in the configuration panel under Tracked Spells. There is an edit box in which you can list upto 16 spell IDs to track. There is also a tool underneath the edit box to help you find Spell IDs from spell names.
