configurable:

spells that you are looking out for
spells that you are willing to provide (not reserved)

maintain list of available CDs

------------
PROTOCOL:

GIVE - ask for a cd
{
	rid = random number to uniquify request
	target = target of message, this is used to filter
                 cross-realm requests which use RAID instead of WHISPER
	spell = the desired spell we want cast on us
	
}

NO - decline a cd request
     this is issued when we are busy with a request already,
     when the cd is on cooldown or otherwise unavailable.
{
	rid = mirrored request id
	target = target of response
}

STATUS - update raid with available cds
{
	spells = {
		spellid, charges, time, 
		...(tuple repeats)

		spellid = spell id 
		charges = charges we have ready
		time = time until another charge becomes available (add 1 to charges when time passes this)
		
	}

}

POLL - request status
{
}

STATUS is given when:
someone joins or leaves the party (add a delay!)
if the status has lost track somehow (checked every 5 seconds)
when a relevant spell goes on cooldown. SPELL_UPDATE_CHARGES, SPELL_UPDATE_COOLDOWN
when a POLL message is received. (after a player reloads their UI)
when a raid encounter starts
